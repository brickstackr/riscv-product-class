Once again the RISC-V output was significantly longer than the x86 output. 
x86 - 124 lines
RISC-V - 164 lines

The x86 code is mostly just mov and add instructions. 
The RISC-V code has a lot of SLLI (Shift Left Logical Immediate) instructions and load instructions.
It's a little bit harder to read.
